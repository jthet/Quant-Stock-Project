# Quant Stock Project

This project is an application that enables users to run various simulations on the stock market using Flask, Docker, Redis database, and Kubernetes clusters. The main objective of the project is to analyze past data and determine the optimal portfolio selection that minimizes risks while maximizing returns (maximizing sharpe ratio).


<h3>Data Used</h3>
To access the data required for the simulations, the application connects to an API called yfinance, which is linked to Yahoo! Finance page. The yfinance API provides the historical stock market data needed for the simulations. Here is a link for more information about yfinance https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/

<h2>Scripts</h2>

<h5>Docker Folder</h5>

`docker-compose.yml` - Composes the docker images into a functioning app with docker-compose up

`Dockerfile.api` - Dockerfile for the quant_stock_api

`Dockerfile.wrk` - Dockerfile for the worker


<h5>Kubernetes Folder</h5>

`quant-data-flask-deployment.yml` - Flask API deployment yml configuration

<h3>Running the script</h3>

### Kubernetes Notes

If you change the redis service name, you must change the value of REDIS-IP to the new name
```
env:
    - name: REDIS-IP
      value: <SERVICE-NAME>
```


If you want to change 'REDIS-IP' to something else on this line
```
redis_ip = os.environ.get('REDIS-IP')
```
You umst also change this line in your docker-compose to whatever you have renamed it to
```
environment:
    REDIS-IP: redis-db
```

### INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN

#### MUST DO!!!

git pull this repository

run
```
cd Quant_Stock_Project
```

Then type:
```
mkdir data
```
This ensures that the redis data saves properly


For testing methods 1 and 2, make sure to use a python debug deployment to exec in to and run the curl commands.
Here is an example yaml file for a debug deployment
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: py-debug-deployment
  labels:
    app: py-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: py-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: py-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: py39
          image: python:3.9
          command: ['sleep', '999999999']
```

#### Method 1 - Kubernetes Deployment of the App

kubectl apply -f all of the yaml files in the kubernetes directory

```
kubectl apply -f quant-data-<file>.yml
```

This sums up using the prebuilt application.

Use the following to exec into the debug deployment and then begin curl commands
```
kubectl exec -it <python-debug-deployment-name> -- /bin/bash
```


#### Method 2 - Kubernetes Deployment of your own image

Using the provided quant_stock_api.py and Dockerfiles, build your own image to your liking.
Use
```
docker build -t <username>/<image-name>:<tag> -f Dockerfile.<api/wrk> .
```
In order to run this image in your application, simply change the image name of jthet/quant_stock_api:1.0.1 and jthet/quant_stock_worker:1.0.1 to whatever you have just built in the flask-deployment.yml file

```
version: "3"

services:
    redis-db:
        image: redis:7
        ports:
            - 6379:6379
        volumes:
            - ../data:/data
        user: "1000:1000"
    flask-app:
        build:
            context: ../
            dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile.api
        depends_on:
            - redis-db
        environment:
            - REDIS-IP=redis-db
        image: <YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_HERE> #lucalabardini/quant:1.0 jthet/quant_stock_api:1.0.1
        ports:
            - 5000:5000
        volumes:
            - ./config.yaml:/config/config.yaml
    worker:
        build:
            context: ../
            dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile.wrk
        depends_on:
            - redis-db
        environment:
            - REDIS-IP=redis-db
        image: <YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_HERE> #lucalabardini/qworker:1.0 jthet/quant_stock_worker:1.0.1
```
After that, follow the steps for Method 1 and you can begin testing the app

#### Method 3 - Docker-Compose

Pull the docker image from dockerhub using (or use your own)
```
docker pull jthet/quant_stock_api:1.0.1
docker pull jthet/quant_stock_worker:1.0.1
```

Then simply type in the terminal:

```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```

Then in a separate terminal run curl commands such as
```
curl localhost:5000/data
```




<h3>Flask app example responses</h3>

#### Note
For methods 1 and 2 be sure to change 'localhost' in the following messages to the IP for the specific flask service
To do so run:
```
kubectl get services
```

This will return something like the following:
```
NAME                                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
quant-data-flask-service   ClusterIP   10.233.4.216    <none>        6379/TCP   6d5h
```
Pick the CLUSTER-IP in the row that has `quant-data-flask-service`


#### Examples

To input a specific ticker
```
curl localhost:5000/tickers/AAPL -X POST
```

returns

```
Ticker posted
```
---

To see which tickers have been posted
```
curl localhost:5000/tickers -X GET
```

returns

```
[
  "APPL",
  "AKTX"
]
```
---

To actually input the given tickers data 
```
curl localhost:5000/data -X POST
```

```
curl localhost:5000/data -X GET
```

returns

```
[
  {
    "End": "Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT",
    "First Price": 0.1283479928970337,
    "Last Price": 163.75999450683594,
    "Start": "Fri, 12 Dec 1980 00:00:00 GMT",
    "TICKER NAME": "AAPL"
  },
  {
    "End": "Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT",
    "First Price": 0.08854199945926666,
    "Last Price": 295.3699951171875,
    "Start": "Thu, 13 Mar 1986 00:00:00 GMT",
    "TICKER NAME": "MSFT"
  }
]
```

for a specific ticker run

```
curl localhost:5000/data/MSFT -X GET
```

```
[
  {
    "End": "Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT",
    "First Price": 0.08854199945926666,
    "Last Price": 295.3699951171875,
    "Start": "Thu, 13 Mar 1986 00:00:00 GMT",
    "TICKER NAME": "MSFT"
  }
]
```

---

To see the price history of a specific stock, queue up a job to post. Make sure the ticker is valid and the data has been posted to the db first. Here is the command to post it

```
curl localhost:5000/jobs/image -X POST -d '{"ticker": "AAPL"}'
```
returns
```
{"id": "a2f38a06-1781-435c-846d-47e76ca67b20", "status": "submitted", "ticker": "AAPL"}
```
Then use the specific job ID to run

```
curl localhost:5000/jobs/"a2f38a06-1781-435c-846d-47e76ca67b20"
```
returns
```
{
  "id": "a2f38a06-1781-435c-846d-47e76ca67b20",
  "status": "complete",
  "ticker": "AAPL"
}
```

Then to actually see the plots, run
```
curl localhost:5000/image/AAPL --output image.png
```

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 47712  100 47712    0     0  11.3M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 11.3M

```

And it will return an image

---
To see the correlation between two stocks users can run, (an example with AAPL & AKTX)

```
curl localhost:5000/correlation/AAPL/AKTX/'2019-05-06'/'2023-04-12'/Open -X GET
```

```
{
  "correlation coefficient": -0.46150834121485207
}
```

To see all of the possible routes and their functionality run
```
curl localhost:5000/help
```

will return this help message
```
